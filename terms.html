      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing or using AutoReply ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not use the Service. These terms apply to all users, including visitors, registered users, and paying subscribers.</p>

      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p>AutoReply is a software-as-a-service platform that monitors social media platforms (Reddit, X, and LinkedIn) for conversations relevant to your product or business. The Service uses AI to identify potential leads and generate reply suggestions that you can review, edit, and post.</p>
      <p>AutoReply does not guarantee any specific results, including lead volume, reply quality, or conversion rates. The effectiveness of the Service depends on your configuration, industry, and market conditions.</p>

      <h2>Account Registration</h2>
      <p>To use AutoReply, you must create an account and provide accurate, complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</p>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old to create an account and use the Service.</p>

      <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree to use AutoReply in compliance with all applicable laws and the terms of service of any connected social media platforms. Specifically, you agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service to send spam, misleading, or deceptive content</li>
        <li>Violate the terms of service of Reddit, X, LinkedIn, or any other connected platform</li>
        <li>Use the Service to harass, abuse, or harm others</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service</li>
        <li>Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose</li>
        <li>Share your account credentials with unauthorized third parties</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>AutoReply and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by AutoReply.ing and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You retain ownership of any content you create using the Service, including customized replies and configurations.</p>
      <p>By using the Service, you grant AutoReply.ing a limited license to process your content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service.</p>

      <h2>Payment &amp; Billing</h2>
      <p>Paid plans are billed on a monthly basis. Prices are listed on our website and may change with 30 days' notice. All fees are non-refundable except where required by law.</p>
      <p>If your payment method fails, we may suspend access to paid features until payment is resolved. You are responsible for any applicable taxes associated with your use of the Service.</p>

      <h2>Free Trial</h2>
      <p>We may offer a free trial period at our discretion. During the trial, you will have access to certain features without charge. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue free trials at any time. No credit card is required to start a free trial.</p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, AutoReply.ing shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or business opportunities, arising from your use of or inability to use the Service.</p>
      <p>AutoReply.ing is not responsible for any actions taken by social media platforms in response to content posted through the Service, including account suspensions, content removals, or other enforcement actions.</p>
      <p>Our total liability for any claims related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that AI-generated replies will be accurate, appropriate, or effective.</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>You may cancel your account at any time through your account settings or by contacting us. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion, with reasonable notice when possible.</p>
      <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. We may retain certain data as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of the Service shall be resolved through good-faith negotiation first, and if necessary, through binding arbitration.</p>

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated terms on our website and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
